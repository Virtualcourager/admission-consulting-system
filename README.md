高校招生咨询工作是高招工作中的重要环节，招生咨询工作可以让学生了解专业特色、招生政策，同时高校也可以第一时间掌握分数分布等重要的相关信息。然而，由于目前缺少有效的电子支撑手段，导致老师工作量大，信息滞后、不准确，宣传口径不一致等问题，严重影响招生咨询工作的效率。本文通过实现招生咨询电子系统中Python客户端子系统，为招生咨询工作提供电子化辅助工具，帮助老师提高招生咨询工作的效率。

本招生咨询系统采用B/S开发模式，Django开发框架，MySQL管理系统的各类数据，使用IIS服务进行部署，编程语言python实现系统后端逻辑，html、JavaScript、CSS实现前端。

目前系统已经能够完成在招生咨询现场辅助老师完成考生信息的收集的存储工作。通过网络传输将数据存入数据库进行汇总。汇总数据可以向各省招生组组长和招生办负责人展示。通过一定的算法分析后能够得出分数线和排名关系预估以及录取分数线预估，提供给招生组长作为确定宣传口径的依据。此外，系统还可以展示招生咨询材料，帮助现场的老师进行宣传；招生组组长和招办老师可以根据相应的权限对系统内的数据进行管理。


Enrollment consultation is an important part of the admissions work, enrollment consultation can allow students to understand professional characteristics, admissions policies, while universities can also be the first time to gain the distribution of scores and other important relevant information. However, due to the current lack of effective electronic applications of support, causing a large workload of teachers, information lagging, inaccurate, inconsistent propaganda caliber and other problems, which seriously affecting the efficiency of the admissions advisory work. In this paper, through the implementation of enrollment consultation system in Python client subsystem, for enrollment consultation to provide electronic aids to help teachers improve the efficiency of enrollment consultation work.

This is an admissions consulting system using B/S development model, Django development framework, MySQL as management system of all kinds of data, using IIS services for deployment, the programming language are python to achieve system back-end logic and html, JavaScript, CSS to achieve the front-end.

The system is now able to complete the storage of information collected from the candidates at the enrollment consultation site. The data is aggregated in a database through a network transmission. The aggregated data can be presented to the head of the provincial admissions team and the staff of the admissions office. The algorithmic analysis of the score line and ranking relationship prediction and admission score line prediction can be used as the basis for the head of the admissions team to determine the propaganda caliber. In addition, the system can display enrollment consultation’s materials to help teachers in the field to exhibit; admissions team leaders and staffs in admissions office can manage the data in the system according to permissions.
